# 🎇 Contributing Guidelines

This document provides a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process for the "My First Open Source Contribution" project. We're thrilled to have your contribution, and remember, every contribution is valued, no matter how small!

## 💻 Before Contributing

Before sending your pull requests, please ensure that you have read and understood the entire contribution guide. If you have any questions or doubts, don't hesitate to reach out.

## 🙌 Contribution

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from fixing typos and improving documentation to implementing new features and profiles. If you are new to open source, this is a great project to start with.

### 🔖 Steps to Contribute

Follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new markdown (`.mdx`) file with your GitHub username as the filename (e.g., `your-username.mdx`).
4. Add your profile information to the markdown file. Include details like your name, bio, skills, interests, and social media links.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. Create a pull request (PR) to the main repository.

### 🔨 Note

- Please do not edit or delete someone else's profile.
- Ensure that your file name is your GitHub username in lowercase (e.g., `johndoe.mdx`).
- Make sure to follow the Markdown and MDX syntax for formatting your profile.

## 🔑 Guidelines

1. If you are a participant or contributor, comment on the issue you want to work on, and wait for assignment.
2. Issues will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.
3. Contributors can open their issues using the issue template, but they need to be verified and labeled by a project admin.
4. Once assigned, please discuss with the team before working on the issue.
5. Pull requests will be merged after review by a project admin.
6. Avoid importing external libraries for basic algorithms. Only use external libraries for more complex tasks.

### 🧲 Pull Requests Review Criteria

1. Fill out the PR template properly when creating a Pull Request.
2. Add your code (`.mdx` file) into the respective folders.
3. Ensure your work is original, not copied from other sources.
4. Comment on your code where necessary for clarity.
5. For front-end changes, provide screenshots and work samples before submitting a PR.
6. Follow the [style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for your work.
7. For any queries or discussions, please feel free to reach out.

## 📍 Additional Points

Here are some additional guidelines:

- Use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file names.
- The basic project folder should have two repositories: `Dataset` and `Model`.
- The `Dataset` should contain related dataset files for the project.
- The `Model` should include program files and other relevant files concerning the project for AI, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, etc.
- The README file should provide a concise and clear description of the project.
