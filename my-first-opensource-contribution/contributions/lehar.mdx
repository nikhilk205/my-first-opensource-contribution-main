here are the  [markdown good practices](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)


<h1 className = 'w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center'>Hello There</h1>

<div className = 'bg-to-r-from-cyan-500-via-red-500-to-yellow-500'>Something intresting</div>
```
const function = async () => {
    console.log('Hey Thereeee')
}

```

# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

 * Unordered lists, and:
  1. One
  1. Two
  1. Three

 * Ordeded list, and:
 1. One
 2. Two
 3. Three

 * More

> Blockquote

And **bold**, *italics*, and even *italics and later **bold***. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
   return foo + ':' + s;
}
```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears

The end ...
