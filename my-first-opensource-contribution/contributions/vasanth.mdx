## Experience

I'm a dedicated student who has embarked on an exciting journey in the fields of AI/ML and Flutter development. Over the past six months, I've been immersing myself in the world of these technologies, eager to learn, grow, and apply my skills to real-world projects. While my journey is still in its early stages, I'm enthusiastic and determined to make a meaningful impact through my work.

## Projects

Though I'm relatively new to AI/ML and Flutter, I've already taken on some interesting projects:

### Expense Tracker App

One of my first projects was developing an expense tracker app. It was a great learning experience, and I gained valuable insights into mobile app development using Flutter. This app allows users to manage their expenses efficiently and has been a foundation for me to build upon.

### Meals App

The Meals App is another project that I've been working on. This application helps users with meal planning and preparation, showcasing my growing skills in creating user-friendly mobile applications.

### Movie Recommender - Machine Learning Model

I've started exploring the fascinating world of AI and machine learning by creating a movie recommender system. While I'm still in the early stages of developing this model, it's a testament to my passion for AI and my aspiration to leverage technology for personalized recommendations.
