# ABOUT ME

I am a third-year computer science student with a deep passion for technology. My goal in life is to use technology to bring about a positive impact on the world, especially for India.

Apart from the world of tech, I am also into Badminton which helps me stay motivated and healthy!

## EXPERIENCE
- I have recently completed an internship at **IIM-Bangalore**, which involved writing a review paper revolving around the impact of Generative AI on modern education systems.
- I have also participated in multiple hackathons, which have provided me with multiple perspectives on solving real-world problems!

## PROJECTS

One interesting project that I have worked on is to predict a forest fire using a CNN and using openCV, detect humans in the calamity, and in turn send the GPS location with coordinates to concerned authorities.

This project also reflects my goal, better tech for a better world!
